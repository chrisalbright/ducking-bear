Data

### Open KeyVal

OpenKeyval is a completely open key-value data store, exposed as a drop-dead simple web service. The goal is to make this a very easy way to persist data in web applications. As an exercise, I'm thinking of re-implementing it in Java or Scala. Maybe make a distributed service using Gizzard
